[Deploy instantly](https://newsdev.github.io/driveshaft/heroku/#deploy-button) with Heroku.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Dependencies

Be sure to have the following system dependencies installed:

``` bash
# Git, Ruby, Node
$ brew install git node ruby

# Bower
$ npm install -g bower

# Bundler
$ gem install bundler
```

### Clone the repository and resolve app dependencies

``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:newsdev/driveshaft.git
$ cd driveshaft
$ bower install
$ bundle install
```

### Environmental Variables

Driveshaft uses environmental variables for configuration. Set the following variables either at runtime on the commandline, or in your `/~.bash_profile`.

Set **at least one**, or several, of the following to authenticate against the Google API. You will need to set up a [Google Developers Project](https://console.developers.google.com/project) with the Drive API enabled. Then create a set of credentials. Public API Keys, and any of the three OAuth2 mechanisms, are supported.

To use an API Key, set `GOOGLE_APICLIENT_KEY` to the key. For any type of OAuth certificate, set the variable to a path to the certificate file, or the contents of the certificate itself.

``` bash
# Public API Key
GOOGLE_APICLIENT_KEY="***"

# Native Application Client
GOOGLE_APICLIENT_CLIENTSECRETS_INSTALLED="***"

# Web Application Client
GOOGLE_APICLIENT_CLIENTSECRETS_WEB="***"

# Service Account
GOOGLE_APICLIENT_CLIENTSECRETS_SERVICEACCOUNT="***"
```

Required for S3 access. Use credentials that have access to any S3 buckets you wish to use.

``` bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="****"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="****"
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
```

Driveshaft settings:

``` bash
DRIVESHAFT_SETTINGS_AUTH_REQUIRED="false" # true to require client-side login
DRIVESHAFT_SETTINGS_AUTH_DOMAIN="nytimes.com" # restrict login to a single domain
DRIVESHAFT_SETTINGS_MAX_VERSIONS="5" # set to a maximum number of previous file versions to keep on S3
```

Optional drive key and s3 destination for a Google Spreadsheet to use to power the index page. It should follow the format of [this spreadhseet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16NZKPy_kyWb_c0jBLo_sTvyoGUrs-ISG7uMDHBMgM5U/edit#gid=0) (you can copy the spreadsheet into a new one to start).

``` bash
DRIVESHAFT_SETTINGS_INDEX_DESTINATION="s3://BUCKET/PATH.json"
DRIVESHAFT_SETTINGS_INDEX_KEY="DRIVE_KEY"
```

$ puma
```
